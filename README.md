# NRLSExampleGenerator
The code within this repository is exemplar code to demonstrate how the FHIR XML content within the NRLS DMS can be created. The DMS is published by NHS Digital here: http://data.developer.nhs.uk/fhir/nrls-v1-draft-a/Chapter.1.About/index.html

These example make use of the opensource JAVA FHIR API located here https://github.com/jamesagnew/hapi-fhir/

The use of this API is for illustration purposes only, by using it NHS Digital makes no endorsement of the API. Implementers are free to use other APIs to create FHIR content or can develop it natively if desired.
